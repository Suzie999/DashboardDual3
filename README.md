📌 TechMeUp Foundation - Power BI Challenge
🚀 Empowering Diversity in Tech Through Data

📖 About This Project
TechMeUp Foundation is a mission-driven tech fund investing in people's opportunities, aiming to create a more diverse and inclusive tech ecosystem.

🎓 As a TechMeUp Scholarship recipient, I had the opportunity to study Data Analytics at Le Wagon. When they launched their Power BI Dual Challenge in collaboration with Get Responsive, I was excited to participate and create a visually compelling dashboard to showcase:
✅ The diverse & talented student pool that benefited from TechMeUp.
✅ Key training & employment outcomes for sponsors & employers.
✅ Deep insights into student demographics, training providers, job placements & more.

⚡ Challenges & Data Wrangling
📌 The dataset was originally in Dutch—a language I’m still learning.
📌 Used Python & Power Query to streamline translation & data cleaning.
📌 The dataset covered 4 years of detailed records (student data, language proficiency, employment).
📌 Advanced DAX measures and Power Query transformations to create an interactive Power BI report.

🏆 Competition Results
🎯 The challenge was open to all experience levels:
✅ 100 participants downloaded the dataset
✅ 29 submitted final dashboards
🏅 I won 3rd place overall + the Beginners Prize! 🎉
